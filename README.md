# FridayMeme

A simple website that displays a "Mufasa Dance gif" when it's Friday and a text message "It's not Friday" on all other days. The website also includes a countdown timer showing the time remaining until the next Friday and a different meme for each day of the week. The website is developed using TypeScript and React, and is deployed on Vercel.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Usage

Open the website and it will automatically display the gif if it's Friday, or the text message if it's not. The page refreshes automatically at midnight. The countdown timer and the meme of the day are displayed below the main content.
